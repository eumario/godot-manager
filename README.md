# Godot Manager

Godot Manager is an **engine version and project management utility**, streamlining the Godot development experience.

Godot Manager supports an assorted list of features, from categorization of your projects, associating your projects with a specific version of Godot, as well as downloading Templates and Plugins that can be used in creating new projects.

With Godot Manager, you can manage the versions of Godot from the official Github repository, as well as use either standard versions of Godot, or the Mono Edition of Godot. Not only can you download these, you will also get updates when new versions of Godot are released. Future versions will implement downloading from Tuxfamily as a mirror, as well as implementing other mirrors for other custom versions of Godot that are out there.

Tired of trying to remember which plugins you want for which projects? Godot Manager will let you download plugins and templates from the official Godot Asset Library, and cache them on your computer. When you create a new project, you can select which plugins you want to include in your new project, as well as select a template you want to base your project on. Making things more streamlined, and easier to use!

Godot Manager supports a decent set of settings that you can use to configure how you want Godot Manager to store your versions of Godot, as well as where to cache downloads, allowing you to ensure certain drives do not get over-stuffed with downloads. You can also configure how to launch the Godot Editor, along with how it should scan for projects, where they are located at, and where to store your projects.

In the future, you will be able to add additional mirrors here, be it for the Asset Library or for the Godot Engines that are out there that you want to install, as long as the engine provides an easy way to track the data.

Any comments, or suggestions are welcome, please feel free to open issues as you need.
